# Resume Match AI ü§ñüíº

Resume Match AI is an automated tool to help job seekers evaluate how well their resume matches a job posting. The app produces a match score, highlights missing keywords/skills, and suggests actionable edits to improve the resume's alignment with an Applicant Tracking System (ATS).

This project is being built to demonstrate end-to-end AI engineering capabilities, from data ingestion and NLP modeling to API deployment and frontend development.
